          My name is Kristi Foreman. I love learning and helping others learn
          how to implement simple, practical steps into their homes and everyday
          lives that inspire and promote whole health and full life. I see whole
          health as the ability to adapt to changes. When our bodies and minds
          are in a state of whole health, we can quickly and appropriately
          respond to and overcome illnesses, changes and even crises. Full life
          is being able to pursue and enjoy life to the fullest with the fewest
          amount of physical, mental or emotional obstacles.
